## Import points to remember
1. Avoid controlling 32 bit apps from 64 bit python and vice versa, for non focus mod only, on windows (works sometimes, sometimes don't, gives warning on terminal always)
2. Restart browsers like chrome which start multiple processes on startup because sometimes they open a background invisible window which screws up code - (happened once in Windows, window closed self in few minutes, didn't happen on restart) 
3. If some gesture isn't working, try resetting the switch in settings
